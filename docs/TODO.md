##About
Contains tasks that need attention sometime in the future. This is not 
meant to be a document that lists ALL the tasks that need to be done. 
The purpose of the document is simply to help me keep a track of tasks
that should eventually be done (and that are likely to be forgotten by
me if not documented).

###Tasks
- Figure out settings stuff.
- Figure out what the jquery.formset.js script does and create another one 
with relevant functionality only.
- RecipeIngredientForm: how to inherit the form from Fridge and change 
exclude, etc., so that I do not have to repeat almost all of the code in it?
- Somehow deal with plurals? Have two values for each unit?
- Refactor tests to use RequestFactory for quicker tests. Relevant link:

- Change ingredient 'type' to something else.
