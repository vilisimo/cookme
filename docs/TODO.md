##About
Contains tasks that need attention as soon as possible. This is not 
meant to be a document that lists ALL the tasks that need to be done. 
The purpose of the document is simply to help me keep a track of tasks
that should eventually be done (and that are likely to be forgotten by
me).

###Tasks
- Create population script for recipes.
- Test login required for fridge.
- Make sure that a user can delete a recipe from his/her fridge.
- Figure out settings stuff.
- Figure out what the jquery.formset.js script does and create another one 
with relevant functionality only.
- Test ListView.

- RecipeIngredientForm: how to inherit the form from Fridge and change 
exclude, etc., so that I do not have to repeat almost all of the code in it?
