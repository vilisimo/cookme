##Idea
The website is designed to be a simple recipe holder with not-too-ugly 
front-end. The user is presented with a simple interface that allows to 
browse recipes that have been added to the 'global' recipe book - just 
as in the usual cooking website. Additionally, user can search for 
ingredient(s) that he/she would like to use: recipes containing those 
ingredients will be shown. Furthermore, user can add recipes and ingredients
to his/her fridge. Once ingredients and recipes are added, user can instruct
the website to search the fridge for recipes that contain ingredients in the 
fridge. 

This is a practice project to get a better grip of Django, Python, CSS, HTML, 
JavaScript, jQuery, Ajax, etc. It is not designed to be the innovative app: 
there are literally dozens of similar websites/apps. Rather, the focus is on 
making main things work first, getting exposure to different technologies, 
rather than providing people with groundbreaking cooking experience or every 
feature that I can think of. 

##About the project
The website is being created on OS X (El Capitan) and Ubuntu 16.04. Testing
is done on Chrome. Focus is more in the area of proof of concept, thus 
compatibility with other browsers is not (at least not yet) the main concern.
That being said, where appropriate, effort will be made to provide similar 
experience on all major browsers - after all, it is also part of mastering web 
technologies.
