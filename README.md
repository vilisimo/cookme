##Idea
The website is designed to be a simple recipe holder with not-too-ugly 
front-end. The user is presented with a simple interface that allows to 
add recipes and ingredients to the fridge, browse what recipes he/she 
has enough ingredients for, favorite interesting recipes and so on.  

This is a practice project to get hang of Django, Python, CSS, HTML, 
JavaScript, jQuery, Ajax, etc. It is not designed to be the innovative 
app: there are dozens of similar websites and apps. 

##About the project
The website was created on OS X (El Capitan) and Ubuntu 16.04. It was 
mainly tested on Chrome. Focus was more in the area of proof of concept,
thus compatibility was not focused on more than necessary.
