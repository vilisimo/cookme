##Idea
The website is designed to be a simple recipe holder with fast, intuitive front-end. 

This is a practice project to get hang of Django, Python, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, jQuery, Ajax, etc.

##About the project
The website was created with MacBook (Late 2011), mainly tested on Chrome. Focus was more in the area of proof of concept, thus compatability was not focused on more than necessary.

### Installation
For installation instructions, please refer [here](../../tree/master/docs/instalation.md).

### Design documents To see the thought process behind the project, refer to the [docs](../../tree/master/docs). An attempt was made to follow agile
practices, but as this is a personal project, documenting enthusiasm was rather often overshadowed by the joy coding.
