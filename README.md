##Idea
The website is designed to be a simple recipe holder with not-too-ugly front-end. The user is presented with a simple interface that allows to add recipes and ingredients to the fridge, browse what recipes he/she has enough ingredients for, favorite interesting recipes and so on.  

This is a practice project to get hang of Django, Python, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, jQuery, Ajax, etc. It is not designed to be the innovative app: there are dozens of similar websites and apps. However, the project was created from a scratch, without copying other projects, as this way is more fun. 

##About the project
The website was created with MacBook (Late 2011), mainly tested on Chrome. Focus was more in the area of proof of concept, thus compatibility was not focused on more than necessary.
