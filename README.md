## Idea
The website is designed to be a simple recipe holder with a simple frontend. 
The user is presented with a clean interface that allows to browse recipes that 
have been added to by the users. Additionally, user can search for ingredient(s) 
that he/she would like to use: recipes containing those them will be shown. 
Furthermore, user can add recipes and ingredients to his/her fridge. Once 
ingredients and recipes are added, user can instruct the website to search 
the fridge for liked recipes that can be made with ingredients in the fridge. 

This is a practice project to get a better grip of Django, Python, CSS, HTML, 
JavaScript, and Ajax. It is not designed to be the innovative app: there are 
dozens of similar websites/apps. Rather, the focus is on getting exposure to 
different technologies rather than providing people with groundbreaking cooking 
experience.  

## About the project
The website is being created on Ubuntu 16.04 and OS X. Testing is done on 
Chrome/Firefox. Focus is more in the area of proof of concept, thus 
compatibility with other browsers is not the main concern. 

### Installation
For installation instructions, please refer

### Progress
At the moment, project is in front-end stage. That is, the website needs 
CSS/HTML editing. Bare minimum of functionality has been achieved, but the 
look of the website is not acceptable yet.
