## Idea
The website is designed to be a simple recipe holder with a plain frontend. 
A user is presented with a clean interface that allows to browse recipes that 
have been added to by the users. Additionally, the user can search for 
ingredient(s) that he/she would like to use: recipes containing those them will 
be shown. Furthermore, user can add recipes and ingredients to his/her fridge. 
Once ingredients and recipes are added, user can instruct the website to search 
the fridge for liked recipes that can be made with ingredients in the fridge. 

This is a practice project to get a better grip of Django, Python, CSS, HTML, 
JavaScript and jQuery. It is not designed to be the innovative app. Rather, the 
focus is on getting exposure to different technologies and understanding how 
everything fits. 

## About the project
The website is being created on Ubuntu 16.04 and OS X. Testing is done on 
Chrome/Firefox. Focus is more in the area of proof of concept, thus 
compatibility with other browsers is not the main concern. 

### Installation
For installation instructions, please refer 
[here](../../tree/master/docs/installation.md).

### Progress
At the moment, project is in JS enhancements stage. That is, the website needs 
JS scripts to be woven into it. Occasionally, small CSS improvements may still 
be added. However, bare minimum of functionality and FE design has been done, 
there are many things that can be done with JS to improve user experience.
   
   - ~~Basic functionality implementation~~
   - ~~Front-end: HTML/CSS~~
   - JavaScript enhancements __(in progress)__
   - Deployment
   - _(Optional)_ Implementation of optional requirements
