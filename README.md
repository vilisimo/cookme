## What is Cookme?
It is a practice website that serves as a simple recipe holder with 
hand-crafted ui. 

A user is presented with a clean interface that enables browsing of recipes 
that have been added by the users. Additionally, the user can search for 
ingredient(s) that he/she would like to use. Recipes containing them will be
shown. Furthermore, user can add recipes and ingredients to his/her fridge.
Once ingredients and recipes are added, user can instruct the website to 
search for liked recipes that can be made with ingredients in the fridge.
