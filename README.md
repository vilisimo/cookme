## Idea
The website is designed to be a simple recipe holder with not-too-ugly 
front-end. The user is presented with a clean interface that allows to 
browse recipes that have been added to the 'global' recipe book - just 
as in any ordinary cooking website. Additionally, user can search for 
ingredient(s) that he/she would like to use: recipes containing those 
ingredients will be shown. Furthermore, user can add recipes and ingredients
to his/her fridge. Once ingredients and recipes are added, user can instruct
the website to search the fridge for recipes that contain ingredients in the 
fridge. 

This is a practice project to get a better grip of Django, Python, CSS, HTML, 
JavaScript, jQuery, Ajax, etc. It is not designed to be the innovative app: 
there are literally dozens of similar websites/apps. Rather, the focus is on 
making main things work first, getting exposure to different technologies, 
rather than providing people with groundbreaking cooking experience or every 
feature that can be thought of.  

## About the project
The website is being created on Ubuntu 16.04 and OS X. Testing is done on 
Chrome/Firefox. Focus is more in the area of proof of concept, thus 
compatibility with other browsers is not (at least not yet) the main concern. 

### Installation
For installation instructions, please refer 
[here](../../tree/master/docs/installation.md).

### Progress
At the moment, project is in front-end stage. That is, the website needs 
CSS/HTML editing. Bare minimum of functionality has been achieved, but the 
look of the website is not acceptable yet.
   
   - Basic functionality implementation _(done)_.
   - Front-end: HTML/CSS __(in process)__.
   - JavaScript enhancements.
   - _(Optional)_ Implementation of optional requirements.
   - Deployment.

### Design documents 
To see the thought process behind the project, refer to the 
[docs](../../tree/master/docs). An attempt was made to follow agile-ish
practices, TDD, etc.
