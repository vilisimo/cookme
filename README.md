##Idea
The website is designed to be a simple recipe holder with fast, intuitive front-end. 

This is a practice project to get hang of Django, Python, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, jQuery, Ajax, etc.

##About the project
The website was created with MacBook (Late 2011), mainly tested on Chrome. Focus was more in the area of proof of concept, thus compatability was not focused on more than necessary.

##Installation
1. Open terminal.
2. Ensure that Python 3.5.2 is installed: `>>> python --version`.
3. Ensure Git is installed: `>>> git --version`.
4. Navigate to the folder where `Cookme` project should live: `>>> cd path/to/where/the/project/should/be`.
5. Enter: `>>> git clone https://github.com/vilisimo/cookme`.
6. __(Optional)__ Ensure virtualenvwrapper is installed: `>>> pip list`. 
  * If it is not, enter `>>> pip install virtualenvwrapper`.
7. __(Optional)__ Create virtual environment for the project: `>>> mkvirtualenv -p python3.5 cookme`.
8. Once cloned, move to project's directory: `>>> cd cookme`.
9. Install required packages: `>>> pip install -r requirements.txt`.
10. Run the server: `>>> python manage.py runserver`.
11. Celebrate the fact that the project is written in python, and there are no more setup steps.
